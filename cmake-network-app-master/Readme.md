The application consists of a client and a server that communicate over a network connection. The client sends messages to the server, which in turn responds to the client's messages. The code sample showcases how to implement the networking functionality in C++, including establishing a connection, sending and receiving messages, and closing the connection.

It makes use of [Asio](https://think-async.com/Asio/), a C++ library that provides asynchronous I/O and networking functionality, making it easier to implement networked applications in C++. The library includes support for sockets, timers, and other networking protocols.

The use of CMake as a build system allows the code to be compiled on multiple platforms, making it easier to distribute and deploy the application on different operating systems.

Overall, the code sample provides a basic example of how to implement a simple network application in C++.
